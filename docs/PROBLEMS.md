# PROBLEMS

Bugs or quirks identified during other work but out of scope to investigate/fix at the time.
Each entry should have enough detail (repro steps, file:line, symptoms) for a future session
to pick up without re-discovering the problem from scratch.

**Status as of 2026-07-23 (cleanup)**: all fully-resolved entries have been removed from this
file - resolution details live in git history (this file's prior revisions) and
`docs/notes/ai/completed.md`. Recently closed, for orientation: the whole PR #111 cluster
(CodeQL triage, both SSRFs, E2EE password-policy endpoint, opaque rotation member IDs,
per-recipient WebSocket payloads, media-proxy URL signing), the WhatsApp/SMS delivery wiring
for every notification toggle, trip-comment `comment_visibility` gating, campus-aware
Wikipedia search (UL-354), the Overpass pool overhaul (UL-355 + self-hosted primary +
empty-result cross-validation), Internet Archive `texts` tiles, the child-pin terminology
sweep, the compose test "pod" for DB-backed tests, and `schedule_panel_fetch`'s broker-outage
handling.

**Closed in the post-cleanup round, same day**: **PinTombstone pruning** (daily
`prune_pin_tombstones` beat task, 400-day retention in
`services.pin_sync.TOMBSTONE_RETENTION`; `pins/deleted/` now returns **410 Gone +
`full_resync_required`** when `deleted_since` predates the retention floor, so pruning can
never cause a silent miss - 3 new tests in `test_external_api.py`), and the **four export
importers** (see the struck entry below for the design decisions that shaped them - 24 new
round-trip tests in `test_export_import_completeness.py`). Everything below is genuinely
still open.

**Feature build, 2026-07-24** (from the ROADMAP.md feature analysis, five of the six
recommended items - see ROADMAP.md for full RESOLVED notes and commit hashes): public pins
by community vote (UL-58), trip-planning OSRM drive-time legs + optional/generated trip
names (UL-60 partial, UL-360), an AI chat assistant with an allowlisted tool loop (UL-293),
KML/GPX/GeoJSON/CSV quick exports + emailed full exports (UL-382, UL-373), and
recency-weighted boundary voting (Pin Restructure section). All five pod-tested green
(60 + 30 = 90 new tests) and browser-verified on dev.urbanlens.org. Offline maps (UL-287,
the sixth recommended item) was intentionally skipped this round. Explicitly **not** built:
UL-377's search/list-scoped targeted exports (blocked on lists, which don't exist yet),
UL-60's AI-driven schedule-timing suggestions and inline "AI suggests pins for this trip" UI
(the assistant can add a specific pin to a trip on request, which covers part of this in a
chat-driven form only), and UL-163's broader AI-sandboxing ticket (MCP security, local
models) - the assistant's allowlist-only tool loop is a first answer to the same concern but
doesn't close that ticket. The boundary-voting dialog auto-opens only while zero votes exist
(not, as the spec's prose could be read, until consensus forms) - a deliberate simplification
worth knowing about if the UX is revisited.

**RESOLVED 2026-07-25**: the `TripMembership.rsvp` choices drift noted above is now migrated -
`0029_alter_tripmembership_rsvp.py` carries the `AlterField` for the `"Going"`/`"Not Coming"`/
`"Maybe"` labels. This checkout briefly had two different, unrelated `0027_*` migrations as
sibling leaves off `0025` (the indoor_outdoor/rsvp work here, and `0027_safety_checkin_partners.py`
from a separate concurrent session); since nothing had been pushed anywhere migration state is
persisted, this was resolved by resequencing instead of a merge migration - the indoor_outdoor
migration was renumbered to `0028` and now depends on `0027_safety_checkin_partners`, with the
rsvp `AlterField` as `0029` after it. Single linear chain, no merge migration needed.

## ~~Verification debt~~ RESOLVED 2026-07-23 (pod ran; all session-added tests pass) → 17 PRE-EXISTING full-suite failures triaged below

**The debt itself is cleared**: the test pod ran for the first time (it works - two workflow
gotchas found and documented in CLAUDE.md: the runner bakes source at build time, and
rebuilding it orphans test-db/test-valkey's shared namespace). The 2026-07-23 rounds' own
test files were executed and now **all pass** - the run surfaced 14 findings (2 real code
bugs in that day's work: the photo-proxy signature was computed over the raw name while
Django delivers the percent-encoded path segment, and same-instance comment re-imports
duplicated once the uuid was taken; plus 6 stale/fragile pre-existing tests) - all fixed in
`06de47fd`/`35ac4100`.

**The FULL suite then ran end-to-end for the first time ever: 6,277 passed, 17 failed
(34m45s).** None of the 17 touch code changed on 2026-07-23; they are pre-existing test debt
that had simply never executed against a real DB. Triage (each verified from the run log,
`/tmp/pod-full.log` on chiron):

- **`test_site_admin_stats` (4) + `test_infrastructure_stats` (1)** - the stats collectors
  probe the real infra services and trip `LocalhostOnlyNetwork` on the dev stack's
  container-bridge IPs (`172.18.0.10`). These tests need the probes mocked (per the repo's
  own testing policy) - they can never pass inside the pod as written.
- **`test_avatar_colors::GroupMemberSearchAvatarColorTests`** - `0 != 4`: member search now
  filters through `can_view_profile`, and the test's baker profiles keep the default
  `profile_visibility` (ANYTHING_IN_COMMON) with nothing in common → 0 results. Stale since
  the member-search masking hardening; fix by setting candidates' visibility (mirror
  `_profile()` in test_identity_visibility.py).
- **`test_flickr_album_import::test_blank_url_shows_an_error`** - the pod has no Flickr
  keys, so the view short-circuits to "Flickr integration is not configured" before the
  blank-URL branch; the test must stub the settings keys.
- **`test_media_own_photos_preview` (2)** - endpoint returns 204 where the tests expect
  200-with-tiles; mechanism not yet dug into (likely fixture gap - files/coords - or a
  moved gate).
- **`test_pin_edit_controller::PinDescriptionEditableTests` (2)** - the rendered page no
  longer carries `data-raw-description=""` / carries `pin-description--empty` unexpectedly;
  description-editor markup drift.
- **`test_profile_hero_meta_editable` (2)** - "Add your area..." placeholders NOW render
  where the tests expect them hidden; either deliberate own-profile placeholder behavior
  change (update tests) or a regression in the hidden-when-empty rule (check intent first).
- **`test_settings_tos_accepted_display`** - "Mar 4, 2025" not found though the label
  renders; date-format drift.
- **`test_pin_media_endpoints::test_media_relevance_route_reaches_the_post_handler`** -
  `TypeError: Cannot mix str and non-str arguments` (an os.path/reverse join receiving a
  Mock/None); needs its traceback read.
- **`test_property_records_plugin`** - `test_the_locations_address_is_passed_through_as_the_situs_search_key`
  assigns `location.address`, which is now a read-only property (`AttributeError: no setter`).

**Suggested next step**: one focused session over these 9 files - none looks like a
production bug on its face (env coupling, fixture rot, template drift), but
`test_media_own_photos_preview`'s 204 and `test_profile_hero_meta_editable`'s
placeholder-visibility change deserve a real look at intent before the tests are edited to
match current behavior. The pod is left running on chiron for it.

## Full-codebase audit (2026-07-25): curated high-severity findings

A systematic full-codebase audit (every model/controller/service/template/TS/SCSS file, all
migrations, the full test suite) ran 2026-07-25, tracked in `docs/notes/ai/codebase-audit.md` (35
units, full findings with file:line references for every bug/inefficiency/improvement found — see
that doc for anything not listed here, including all "improvement"-grade and maintainability
findings). This section curates only the highest-severity/highest-impact items into this file's
convention; the full ranked list per feature area is more complete.

**SSRF: Immich server URL is user-controlled with no private-IP/scheme guard.**
`models/immich/model.py:83` (`ImmichAccount.server_url`, via `forms/immich_form.py`) accepts any
well-formed URL with no loopback/private/link-local restriction. `controllers/immich.py:108-110`
(`ImmichSettingsView.post`) pings it server-side before saving, and later flows
(`get_map_markers`/`get_asset_thumbnail`/`get_asset_original`) proxy the response back to the
browser. Any authenticated user can point `server_url` at internal infrastructure
(`http://169.254.169.254/`, `http://localhost:6379/`, an internal admin panel) and use the
ping/thumbnail endpoints as an authenticated blind-SSRF oracle. Self-hosted-by-design feature, so
risk is single-tenant, but worth a scheme/private-IP guard in `clean_server_url`.

**SSRF: `services/url_safety.py`'s IP blocklist misses RFC 6598 CGNAT space.**
`is_blocked_address` (`url_safety.py:20-22`) checks `is_private`/`is_loopback`/`is_link_local`/
`is_reserved`/`is_multicast` but not the `100.64.0.0/10` Carrier-Grade-NAT range — verified
`ipaddress.ip_address("100.64.0.5")` returns `False` for every one of those checks. Many cloud
providers route internal-only infra (AWS NAT gateways, GCP internal LBs) through this range, so a
user-supplied URL resolving there sails through `ensure_public_http_url` unblocked. This is the
*only* IP-range guard for AI link extraction (`services/ai/link_extraction.py`), pin-suggestion
photo download (`services/pin_suggestions.py`), and media materialization
(`services/media_materialize.py`) — one missed CIDR range is a gap in three subsystems at once.

**Decompression-bomb protection in the full-archive importer only checks forgeable declared
sizes.** `services/import_data.py:275-289` sums each ZIP member's *declared* `file_size` against a
ceiling, then calls `zf.extractall()` unbounded. `file_size` in ZIP headers is attacker-controlled;
Python's `zipfile` only detects a declared-vs-actual mismatch via CRC32 *after* a member is fully
decompressed and written to disk. A crafted archive well within the 500MB upload cap
(`controllers/tools.py:330`) with forged small `file_size` fields but highly compressible payloads
can decompress to hundreds of GB before the mismatch is caught. The project's own
`services/archive_extractor.py:_extract_zip` (lines 299-311) already guards this correctly (caps
each member read, rejects on overrun) — `import_data.py` just doesn't reuse it. A companion gap:
`services/import_formats/gpx.py:41` / `gpx_tracks.py:140` parse GPX XML via `gpxpy` with no
`defusedxml` wrapper (unlike `osm_xml.py`, which correctly uses one) — a latent XXE surface since
`lxml` is installed and `gpxpy` prefers it.

**WebSocket consumers crash on any binary frame, leaking channel-layer group membership.**
Every consumer in `dashboard/consumers.py` (lines 54, 133, 409, 599, 733) declares
`async def receive(self, text_data):` with no `bytes_data` parameter. Channels' base
`AsyncWebsocketConsumer` calls `receive(bytes_data=...)` for any binary WS frame, raising an
uncaught `TypeError` that propagates out of the ASGI coroutine — `disconnect()`/`group_discard()`
never runs, so the dead `channel_name` stays registered in whatever group(s) it had joined. Any
client (buggy library, proxy, or deliberate probe) sending one binary frame on `ws/notifications/`,
`ws/messages/`, or either safety-checkin socket kills the connection ungracefully. Affects all five
consumer classes identically — fix once at the base-class level.

**Two rate-limit/quota checks with the same non-atomic check-then-act race**, each independently
discovered:
- `services/rate_limiter.py:279-491` — `check_rate_limit` (COUNT) and `log_api_call` (INSERT) are
  separate operations with no locking; concurrent requests can all pass the check before any log,
  breaching even Nominatim's hard 1 req/sec ToS limit under a handful of simultaneous pin-detail loads.
- `services/email_safety.py:89-111` (`email_rate_limit_error`) — same shape for outbound
  friend-invite/visit-invite emails (`controllers/friendship.py:649-720`,
  `services/visit_invites.py:82-109`); concurrent requests can exceed the configured hourly/daily/
  monthly cap arbitrarily.
Both need either `select_for_update()` around the count+log pair or an atomic increment
(`cache.add()`-style) rather than read-then-write.

**AI provider token/cost accounting is silently doubled for 2 of 3 wired providers.**
`services/ai/gateway.py:385-391` calls `self.receive_tokens(message)` in the shared
`send_prompt`/`send_prompt_list`, but `services/ai/anthropic.py:117` and `services/ai/openai.py:121`
*also* call `self.receive_tokens(body)` inside their own `_parse_response()` — double-counting the
same response. `services/ai/cloudflare.py`'s parser correctly does *not* self-call, proving the
other two are a regression rather than by design. Every assistant-chat, document-import, vision-keyword,
and auto-tag cost/token estimate for Anthropic and OpenAI is currently ~2x actual.

**Friend-request-visibility bypass via the email-invite path.**
`controllers/friendship.py:666` (`invite_by_email`) only checks
`to_profile.friend_request_visibility != VisibilityChoice.NO_ONE` for a matched existing account,
unlike `request_friend` (line 317) which runs the full `Profile.visibility_permits` evaluator. A
profile restricted to `FRIENDS`/`COMMON_PIN`/`COMMON_FRIEND`/`COMMON_TRIP`/`ANYTHING_IN_COMMON`
(anything short of `NO_ONE`) can still be friend-requested by any stranger who knows their email.
Only the `NO_ONE` case has test coverage (`test_friend_invite_privacy.py`).

**`common_pin_count` is shown regardless of its own visibility gate.**
`controllers/userprofile.py:157-158` + `templates/pages/profile/index.html:66-77` — the *count* of
shared pins between two profiles is computed and rendered unconditionally; only the link to the
detail page is gated by `can_view_common_pins_with` (default `FRIENDS`). Any two logged-in
strangers see e.g. "3 Places in Common" even when the setting says only friends should know the
overlap exists at all.

**Login-lockout is keyed on the raw submitted string, not the resolved account — brute-force is
bypassable.** `controllers/account.py:51-58,623-634,657-692` keys failed-attempt/lockout counters
by the literal POSTed "username" value, but `EmailOrUsernameModelBackend`
(`services/auth_backend.py:14-36`) resolves that same field against primary email, verified
secondary email, and Gmail dot/plus-normalized variants before authenticating. An attacker can
brute-force one account indefinitely by rotating through equivalent-but-textually-distinct login
strings (`victim@gmail.com`, `vic.tim@gmail.com`, `v.ictim+x@gmail.com`, a secondary email — each
gets its own untripped counter). `test_email_login.py` proves the login path treats these as
identical; no equivalent test exists for the lockout path.

**`Label` kind-conversion has no branch for converting to Category — silently orphans the row.**
`controllers/labels.py:467-478` (`_apply_kind_conversion`) handles converting to Status/Tag but has
no branch for `new_kind == KIND_CATEGORY`. Converting a global Tag to a Category via the standard
edit form leaves `label.profile=None`, but Category lookups use exact-match `.for_profile()` with
no global fallback — the label vanishes from every Organize > Categories listing, and
`_can_modify_label` returns `False` for any non-tag label with `profile=None`, making the row
**permanently un-editable and un-deletable through the UI** (recoverable only via direct DB access).

**Safety check-in escalation can re-email every emergency contact on any partial failure.**
`services/safety.py:940-981` (`escalate_checkin`) loops all contacts unconditionally (no
`notified_at__isnull=True` filter) and only saves `status`/`escalated_at` *after* the whole loop
completes. If anything raises mid-loop (bad email address, a non-SMTP/OSError mail-backend
exception), the checkin never flips to `OVERDUE`, so the next 5-minute beat tick re-matches it and
re-emails every contact already notified — including real emergency contacts during an actual
safety incident. Compare `_resolve_as_found_safe` (line 1038-1044), which correctly flips status
*before* its own contact loop for exactly this reason. Compounding gap: the three checkin beat
tasks (`tasks.py:1629-1671`) run every 5 minutes with no locking, unlike the `RUN_LOCK_CACHE_KEY`
pattern already established elsewhere in the same file for this exact problem.

**SpotGuessr/Trivia: an invited-but-never-joined participant can still submit a scoring answer.**
`services/trivia/session.py:279-349` + `controllers/trivia.py:43-52` (`submit_answer`) never
verifies `TriviaSessionParticipant.status == JOINED` before accepting an answer — an
INVITED-but-not-joined participant can score points and inflate the answer count used to decide
round completion, potentially closing a round before all actually-joined players have answered.
**The identical gap exists in `services/spotguessr/session.py:submit_guess`** (no status check
there either) — a shared architectural hole across both game features, not specific to either one.

**Undefined CSS custom-property references silently disable dark-mode theming in ~10 SCSS files.**
`var(--text, …)`, `var(--text-muted, …)`, `var(--ul-surface-alt, …)`, `var(--ul-accent, …)`, and
several others are used throughout `_e2ee.scss` (13x), `_setup.scss` (12x), `_markup.scss`,
`_webauthn.scss`, `_messages.scss`, `_gallery.scss`, `_games.scss`, `_trivia.scss`,
`_assistant.scss`, `_pin-detail.scss`, `_profile.scss`, and `_wiki.scss` — but none of these custom
properties is ever defined anywhere (`_tokens.scss`/`_surfaces.scss` grepped, zero matches). Every
one of these rules permanently renders its hex fallback and can never respond to
`[data-theme="dark"]`, despite reading as token-driven. This is a broader, previously-uncaught
instance of the color-token issue the 2026-07-23 `_explainer`/`_map`/`_e2ee` review resolved as
"fine" — that review apparently didn't verify the referenced tokens actually exist.

## UL-277: pin-detail external-data freshness window is one global knob, not per-source

**PARKED 2026-07-23 at Jess's request ("skip over this one for right now. I need to reassess
this another day").**

Original wording: "Cache time needs adjustments for some pin details data. Load page, wait 10
minutes, reload page, some items are marked as 'fresh'." The mechanism is technically correct
(`LocationCache.set()` bumps `updated` properly); the actual gap is that `LocationCache.is_stale`
compares against a single site-wide, multi-day `SiteSettings.external_data_cache_days` applied
identically to every external-data source. Implementing this properly means a per-source TTL
override (a field on `PanelSource`/`InfoPanelSource`, or a source→days mapping in
`SiteSettings`) defaulting to the existing global value - plus knowing which sources the
reporter considers too slow to refresh.

## ~~UL-255: "Remember last map position"~~ (RESOLVED 2026-07-23 - browser-verified WORKING, recommend closing)

**RESOLVED 2026-07-23**: reproduced the exact suspect scenario in a real browser against dev
(Playwright, REMEMBER mode enabled, remembered position cleared first): two real mouse-drag
pans fired 2 debounced POSTs to `settings/map-position/` with the panned coordinates, and a
**fresh navigation to the bare map URL** (no `?lat/lng/zoom`) restored the view to the exact
remembered position - delta 0.00000°/0.00000°, zoom matched. The REMEMBER chain works
end-to-end on fresh navigation, and Jess confirmed the other scenario (same-tab reload where
URL params win) is intended behavior. Both possible readings of the original report are
therefore accounted for; recommend closing UL-255. If it recurs, capture the exact
navigation path - the repro script is `ul255.js` in this session's scratchpad pattern
(login → pan → fresh goto → compare `map.getCenter()`).

## ~~Saved-filter include/exclude label picker: no drag-reorder or formula mode~~ (RESOLVED 2026-07-23, browser-verified on dev)

**RESOLVED 2026-07-23** - the authorized extraction is done and verified live:

- **`frontend/ts/shared/label-picker.ts`** (installed globally as
  `window.UrbanLensLabelPicker` by core.js) now owns both picker shapes:
  `createFilterPicker` (the map sidebar's full engine - include/exclude columns, chip
  dragging, AND/OR combinator, formula bar with tokenizer/parser/suggestions,
  `label_groups` serialization) and `createChipPicker` (the flat search+chips component the
  bulk-edit dialog and saved-filter scripts each used to duplicate). One deliberate
  improvement over the inline original: label names are HTML-escaped in generated
  chip/suggestion markup (the old code interpolated them raw - a UL-362-class XSS vector).
- **Main map**: the ~650-line inline engine is gone; the page instantiates the module
  against the existing fp-* DOM (inline on* handlers removed - the module wires delegated
  listeners, which also covers labels appended later by the create-label dialog).
  `applySavedFilter` merges via `mergeIncludeIds`, reset via `clear()`.
- **Bulk-edit dialog**: `_makeLabelChipPicker` is a thin id-based wrapper over
  `createChipPicker`. The rich include/exclude pairing deliberately does NOT apply there -
  add-labels and remove-labels are separate actions with separate candidate pools.
- **Saved-filter dialog + detail page**: the two flat pickers became ONE rich picker
  (`_saved_filter_label_picker.html`, sf-* ids, reusing the global fp-* styles). It
  serializes structured `label_groups` into the form (the create/edit endpoints already
  parsed that field) AND mirrors flat `tags`/`exclude_tags` hidden checkboxes; it seeds
  from stored groups (falling back to flat sets), so formulas round-trip and the "advanced
  rules will be replaced" warning was removed as no longer true.

**Browser-verified on dev.urbanlens.org** (Playwright in the official image on the chiron
VM, driving a real login): 22/22 checks - click-include, right-click-exclude, AND/OR
toggle, chip drag include→exclude, chip-click removal, formula `(Visited / Rooftop) -
Demolished` parsing to `[{or,[..]},{not,[..]}]`, filter POSTs firing, and on the
saved-filter page: seeding from flat criteria, hidden-input sync, formula entry, save, and
byte-identical `label_groups` round-trip after reload (map preview showed exactly the 2
matching pins). Screenshots reviewed. Remaining follow-up: the two updated template tests
(`test_saved_filter_detail.py`, `test_region_filter.py`) run in the compose test pod with
the rest of the verification-debt list.

## ~~Data export: comments/photos/trips/direct_messages have no importer~~ (RESOLVED 2026-07-23)

**RESOLVED 2026-07-23** - all four built (`_import_comments`/`_import_photos`/`_import_trips`/
`_import_direct_messages` in `services/import_data.py`, wired into `_IMPORT_ORDER` between
visit_history and connections). Export shape fixed first: `_resolve_target` now emits a
`target_uuid` (pin or wiki uuid; names are matched never), photos metadata gained
`media_type`, trips gained `is_creator` + `member_uuids`, and DM rows gained `partner_uuid`
(withheld whenever the partner's identity is masked from the exporter). Design decisions,
recorded because they're deliberately narrower than "import everything":

- **Comments**: uuid-idempotent; pin targets must resolve to the importer's OWN pin (via
  `pin_uuid_map` or direct lookup) and wiki targets must pass `location_visible_to` - a
  user-supplied archive can neither attach content to someone else's pin nor to a wiki its
  owner can't see. Unresolvable targets skip with a warning (an orphan comment renders
  nowhere). Exported `created` timestamps are preserved via post-create `update()`.
- **Photos**: files re-enter storage through the same `file_size_error_for_upload` /
  `quota_error_for_upload` checks as a fresh upload (archive contents were already
  malware-scanned at extraction); metadata filenames are `basename()`-neutralized against
  traversal; unresolvable targets still import as unattached uploads (the file is the user's
  own data regardless); labels reattach via `label_uuid_map`.
- **Trips**: requests-not-facts, mirroring `_import_connections` - only trips the user
  *created* are rebuilt (`is_creator`), an existing uuid is never claimed, and exported
  members are re-invited only when they're the importer's current connections, as
  `STATUS_INVITED` (with the standard added-to-trip notification), capped by
  `max_trip_members` / the upcoming-trips limit.
- **Direct messages**: only the user's own SENT PLAINTEXT rows are restored - received rows
  would let a crafted archive fabricate messages "from" a real user, and encrypted rows are
  sealed to the exporting account's key material the server can't re-wrap (the ciphertext
  stays readable in the archive itself; decision adjusted from "import ciphertext rows"
  during implementation for exactly that reason). Restores require the partner to exist,
  `can_direct_message` to still permit, and no mute either way; rows are inserted directly
  (never through `create_direct_message`) so restoring history pushes no live events, bell
  notifications, or text alerts at the partner; exported read state and timestamps are
  preserved so nothing lands as new/unread.

24 round-trip tests in `test_export_import_completeness.py` (DB-backed - see the
verification-debt entry above).

## Authenticated media gate - residual per-family risk (2026-07-23)

`/media/...` is now served through `dashboard.controllers.media.MediaGateView` (nginx `location
/media/` proxies to Django; authorized responses hand back to the `internal`-only
`/_protected_media/` alias via X-Accel-Redirect). Ownership is enforced per path family where it
is cleanly derivable, but several families intentionally fall back to **authenticated-only**
access (any logged-in user can fetch, no per-object check). Marked with `TODO(media-auth)`
comments in `src/urbanlens/dashboard/controllers/media.py`:

- **`pin_custom_icons/` (Pin.custom_icon) and `label_icons/` (Label.custom_icon)**:
  authenticated-only. Strict owner-only enforcement risks breaking any surface that renders
  another user's shared/labeled pin (shared pin views, trip member maps, global labels with
  `profile=None`). Residual risk is low (small decorative icons, not photos), but a determined
  enumerator could fetch other users' custom icons. Fix would be: owner OR global label OR an
  existing share/visibility relationship.
- **Orphan files** (a file on disk under `pin_images/` or `comment_images/` whose owning
  Image/Comment/TripComment row no longer exists, e.g. row deleted without file cleanup):
  authenticated-only, since there is no owner left to check. Residual risk: pre-existing orphans
  from deletions remain fetchable by any logged-in user who knows the filename.
- **Unknown path families** (anything under MEDIA_ROOT outside the cataloged prefixes
  `pin_images/`, `comment_images/`, `avatars/`, `pin_custom_icons/`, `label_icons/`):
  authenticated-only, logged at INFO. Any future `upload_to` prefix must get an explicit branch
  in `MediaGateView._authorized` or it silently inherits this fallback.
- **`avatars/` (Profile.avatar)**: deliberately any-authenticated-user (avatars render site-wide
  next to usernames) - not a gap, but noted for completeness.
- **Safety check-in photos** (`Image.safety_checkin` set) currently follow the generic
  `Image.objects.visible_to` photo-visibility logic rather than the safety feature's own
  contact-sharing rules; if check-ins are ever shared with emergency contacts who fail the
  photo-visibility check, those contacts would be denied the photos (and vice versa: users
  passing `visible_to` but outside the check-in's audience can fetch them).

**Suggested next step**: product decision on icon visibility (owner-only + share-relationship vs.
authenticated-only), a cleanup job for orphaned media files, and a review of safety check-in photo
audience rules.

## ~~Hardcoded (non-theme-aware) `#2563eb`/`#4f46e5` blue in `_explainer.scss`, `_map.scss`, `_e2ee.scss`~~ (RESOLVED 2026-07-23 - browser-verified acceptable in both themes, no change needed)

**RESOLVED 2026-07-23**: the browser verification the entry was waiting for happened - the
components were rendered in BOTH themes (real login on dev; the explainer/toggle/E2EE-button
composite via an injected exact-markup probe, plus the map onboarding card observed live
during the label-picker verification) and none is a legibility bug:

- **Explainer** (`.ul-page-explainer` + the (?) toggle): legible in light and dark; the blue
  "TIP" kicker on the dark glass panel is the lowest-contrast piece but reads clearly (bold,
  uppercase, short) - deliberate branding, not breakage.
- **Map onboarding card** (`_map.scss` gradient icon + `FAST START` eyebrow): verified live
  in dark mode during the picker work - legible.
- **E2EE** (`#4f46e5`): a solid indigo button with white text (theme-independent by
  construction) and a title-icon accent - fine in both themes.

Per Jess's decision these were left untouched; converting them to `--ul-primary-color`
tokens remains optional polish, not a defect. Screenshot evidence: `blues-probe-dark.png` /
`blues-probe-light.png` from this session's verification run.

## Internet Archive: uploader-supplied `subject` tags are a residual noise floor (found 2026-07-22)

The relevance fix matches the location name against `title` OR `subject`. `subject` is
uploader-supplied and unmoderated, so an item tagged with a landmark it isn't actually about still
passes - a live search for `Eastern State Penitentiary` kept `WWE Studio Shots 2006` on a subject
match. Precision is vastly better than before (the same pin previously returned Voice of America
radio broadcasts via full-text matching), and dropping `subject` from `_NAME_FIELDS` would lose
genuine untitled photographs, so this was accepted rather than tightened.

**Suggested next step**: if it proves noisy in practice, rank title matches above subject-only
matches rather than excluding the latter.

## Overpass deploy-side follow-up: raise the openresty 90s proxy cap (found 2026-07-22; edge box located 2026-07-23)

The self-hosted Overpass instance (`overpass.osm.urbanlens.org`, now the primary endpoint) sits
behind an openresty reverse proxy that cuts every connection at exactly 90s, regardless of the
Overpass `[timeout:N]` the client requested - the benchmark's only self-hosted failures were
region-scale scans hitting this cap, not Overpass giving up (see
`docs/overpass-mirror-test.md`). Until the proxy timeout is raised above the intended
`[timeout:N]` ceiling, any query needing >90s fails at the proxy.

**Narrowed 2026-07-23**: the Overpass container itself runs on chiron
(`overpass`, `wiktorn/overpass-api:latest`, host port 21890), but the openresty is NOT on
chiron (no 80/443 listener, no openresty/nginx service there; the domain resolves to
163.182.80.211, a separate edge box proxying to chiron:21890). Raising the cap means editing
`proxy_read_timeout`/`proxy_send_timeout` (or the openresty equivalent) on that edge box -
access only Jess has.

## Deferred from 2026-07-22: aliases/labels aggregation, and boundary voting

The ROADMAP's "Pin Restructure" section asks for two more things deliberately not attempted as
riders on other work:

**Aliases and labels are not yet aggregated across child pins.** The parent detail page's "show
child pin details" toggle now aggregates map markers, the photo gallery, visit history, and
Notes/comments - but `pin_alias_suggestions` (`controllers/pin.py`) and the
category/tag/status membership panel (`controllers/labels.py`'s `LabelPinMembershipView` /
`label_membership_panel.html`) are both strictly per-pin, with no descendant awareness. Both are
shared generic components also used for Wiki and Image label/alias editing - bolting
hierarchy-aware aggregation onto them risks either duplicating the template or polluting a
generic component with a pin-specific concern. Decide whether aggregation means read-only "also
shown on child pin X" listings (cheapest, matches what comments got) or genuine cross-pin
editing before touching the shared templates.

**Boundary-source voting (REData vs. Overpass, weighted by recency) was not started at all.** It
needs a new model (`BoundaryVote` or similar), a weighting/tie-breaking algorithm, a comparison
dialog with a side-by-side map, and a way to surface "cast a vote" once consensus already exists -
a materially larger, standalone feature (see ROADMAP.md's "Pin Restructure" section, last
bullet, which specifies the weighting rule in detail).

## `docker compose exec app pytest` can't reach Valkey in the `s1`/`s2`/`s3` dev environments (found 2026-07-24)

Running the hypothesis suite via `docker compose exec app python -m pytest ...` inside any of
the `~/dev/s1|s2|s3/UrbanLens` environments on chiron fails almost every test that touches a
logged-in request or Celery/Channels broadcast (`realtime.broadcast`, channel-layer setup, etc.)
with:

```
RuntimeError: External network access is disabled during tests. Attempted to connect to
'172.23.0.3'; mock this integration or use localhost.
```

Root cause: `src/urbanlens/core/testing_network.py`'s `LocalhostOnlyNetwork` guard only permits
connections to literal `localhost`/`localhost.localdomain` during tests (by design - see its
docstring). But in these dev environments, `UL_VALKEY_URL` resolves to the `urbanlens_valkey`
docker-compose service, i.e. a docker-network IP (`172.23.0.3` in this instance), not
`localhost` - so anything touching Valkey during a test run trips the guard immediately.

Confirmed this is **environment infrastructure, not application code**: a completely unrelated,
untouched test file (`test_games_controller.py`) fails identically. Meanwhile, pure-DB-layer
tests with no client/channel-layer involvement (e.g. `test_spotguessr_eligibility.py`) pass
cleanly in the same run - so the guard itself and the DB-layer test infra are fine; it's
specifically the Valkey reachability-vs-guard mismatch.

Not investigated further (out of scope for the SpotGuessr UX work this was found during): worth
checking whether `docker-compose.yml`'s `app` service should bind-mount/forward Valkey to
`localhost` for these dev boxes specifically (other deployments may already do this correctly,
or CI may run tests a different way that sidesteps it entirely - e.g. a dedicated test compose
profile). Until fixed, verify backend changes on these dev machines via direct DB-layer/service
tests (no Django test client, no `realtime.broadcast`) plus a manual browser walkthrough against
the running `docker compose up` stack, rather than the full `pytest` suite.

## SpotGuessr: down-voted photos permanently shrink a small pin pool's playable rounds, with no expiry (found 2026-07-25)

Reported symptom: after playing one full solo session against a ~10-pin pool, starting a new
session sometimes shows the empty state ("Nothing to play yet") even though the profile clearly
has pins and no restrictive settings are active.

Root cause: `services.spotguessr.photos.candidate_image_for_location()`'s default
(`allow_arbitrary_external_photos=False`) excludes any externally-sourced candidate photo whose
`services.media_relevance.effective_relevance()` score is negative. That score is fed by
`GamePhotoFeedback` rows (`services.spotguessr.relevance`) - thumbs-down/report reactions from
*any* past session, against *any* profile - and those rows never expire or get reset. For a
small pin pool where most or all locations have exactly one candidate photo, a handful of
thumbs-down votes accumulated during ordinary play can permanently knock that pool's only
playable photos below the eligibility threshold in *every future session*, with no way for the
player to know that's what happened (the empty-state copy just says nothing matched their
settings).

This is a real, separate bug from the "nothing to play yet" UX/response-shape issues fixed
alongside this note (see `docs/designs/spotguessr.md` and `controllers.spotguessr
.SpotGuessrStartView`) - it's a photo-inventory/relevance-decay *policy* question (should
`GamePhotoFeedback`'s influence decay over time? should a location with zero remaining eligible
photos fall back to `allow_arbitrary_external_photos`-style leniency automatically rather than
requiring the player to discover and toggle it? should thumbs-down carry less weight than it
currently does for small pools specifically?) that's bigger than a UX pass should decide
unprompted. Not investigated further here; worth a dedicated look before it's reported again as
"the game stopped working."

## ~~SiteSettings.ai_article_expansion_enabled / ai_article_safety_enabled have no migration~~ (found and fixed 2026-07-25)

While generating a migration for an unrelated new `SiteSettings` field
(`ai_trivia_wiki_incorporation_enabled`, Trivia Phase 4), `manage.py makemigrations` reported
these two fields as pending additions even though both are already defined on the model and have
been in use since the "Implement AI article expansion and safety review features" commit. The
migration squash ("squash into single migration for release") apparently ran before that commit's
own migration was authored, or that migration was never committed - every test that creates a
`SiteSettings` row (effectively the whole suite, via `promote_first_user_if_needed`'s
`SiteSettings.objects.get_or_create`) failed with `ProgrammingError: column
dashboard_site_settings.ai_article_expansion_enabled does not exist` on a freshly migrated DB.
Initially left out of Trivia Phase 4's own migration as out-of-scope, but ended up blocking that
same phase's dev-pod verification (wiki incorporation directly reuses the article-expansion
pipeline), so it was folded into
`0011_trivia_wiki_incorporation_setting.py` alongside the Trivia field rather than filed away
again - see that migration's own comment.

## Setup wizard sidebar reuses inverting `--ul-grey-N` tokens on an always-dark panel (found 2026-07-25)

`_setup.scss`'s `.setup-wizard__sidebar` sets `background: rgba(0,0,0,0.3)` on top of whatever
the parent `@include surface()` background is - like the map filter panel and a few other
"always dark" chrome panels called out in `_tokens.scss`'s comments, it reads as a fixed dark
strip in both themes rather than genuinely inverting. But unlike those other always-dark panels,
its child text (`.brand-name`, `.setup-stepper__item`, etc.) uses the regular inverting
`var(--ul-grey-1)` / `var(--ul-grey-5)` / `var(--ul-grey-6)` / `var(--ul-grey-7)` tokens. In light
mode `--ul-grey-1` is a near-white (`#dfdfdf`), which reads fine against the dark sidebar overlay.
In dark mode `--ul-grey-1` flips to a near-black grey (`$color-grey-8`, `#373737`), which is
low-to-no contrast against that same dark sidebar background - the sidebar text likely becomes
close to unreadable in dark mode. Not fixed here because it's a structural mismatch (the
component assumes a static-dark treatment but was styled with tokens meant to invert), not a
missing/undefined custom property - fixing it means either converting the sidebar's own text
tokens to a fixed light-on-dark scheme (like `_tokens.scss`'s `$ui-fp-*`/`$ui-link-on-dark`
pattern for the map filter panel) or making the sidebar itself genuinely theme-aware. Worth a
manual dark-mode check of `/setup` before shipping.

## A few more hardcoded danger-red controls without dark overrides in `_pin_lists.scss` (found 2026-07-25)

While fixing the `.saved-filter-region-mode-btn--active` include/exclude buttons (raw
`#2e7d32`/`#c62828`, now real `--ul-color-success-text`/`--ul-color-danger-text` tokens), noticed
several sibling controls in the same file with the identical pattern that were **not** in scope
for that fix: `.pin-list-more-menu-danger` (`color: #ef4444 !important`, ~line 325),
`.saved-filter-delete-btn` (`color: #ef4444`, ~line 629), and a related hover state at ~line 521
(`color: #fca5a5`). None has a `[data-theme="dark"]`/`_dark.scss` counterpart. Given
`--ul-color-danger-text` now exists and already resolves correctly in both themes, these three
are likely a quick follow-up: swap the raw hex for `var(--ul-color-danger-text, <original-hex>)`
the same way the region-mode buttons were fixed.

## Safety check-in partners: two residual gaps found during a fresh-eyes feature review (2026-07-25)

A full review of the partner/live-location/post-resolution-encryption feature (two independent
review agents, backend-correctness and frontend-security) found and fixed nine issues directly
in `services/safety.py`/`consumers.py`/`tasks.py`/`models/safety/model.py` (archival payload not
capturing/severing `destination_location`/`trip`/`markup_map`/`markup_maps`, `archive_checkin`
non-atomicity, chat messages postable after archival, three TOCTOU races, a missing index, an
N+1, and no live-connection revocation on partner removal - all covered by new tests in
`test_safety_archival.py`/`test_safety_partners.py`/`test_safety_live_location.py`/`test_safety.py`).
Two narrower items were identified but deliberately left open:

- **Blocking a partner doesn't revoke their existing access.** `Profile.are_blocked` creation has
  no signal wired to `SafetyCheckinPartner` cleanup - blocking someone who is already an accepted
  partner on one of your check-ins leaves that `SafetyCheckinPartner` row (and any open WebSocket
  connection) intact. `remove_checkin_partner` now correctly force-closes a live connection and
  is the right mechanism to call, but nothing currently calls it from the blocking flow. Fix would
  be a signal/hook on block-creation that calls `remove_checkin_partner` for every
  `SafetyCheckinPartner` row between the two profiles (either direction).
- **A malformed/corrupted `MessagingKeyBundle.public_key` makes `archive_checkin` fail forever,
  loudly but without escalation.** `archive_checkin` now isolates one checkin's failure from
  others in the 5-minute sweep (a bad row no longer blocks the rest of the batch) and every
  attempt is logged via `logger.exception`, but there's still no cap or alerting on repeated
  failures for the *same* checkin - it will silently retry and re-fail every 5 minutes
  indefinitely if a specific owner's key bundle is genuinely corrupt, with only a log line as the
  trail. Not expected to happen in practice (enrollment writes a fresh valid key), but there's no
  guard against it happening anyway (e.g. a future data-migration bug). Worth a "give up and flag
  for manual review after N failed attempts" backstop if this class of bug ever surfaces in
  practice.

## `test_post_without_name_returns_400` is stale against UL-360's optional-name behavior

`test_trip_controller.py::TripCreateViewTests::test_post_without_name_returns_400` (line ~224)
posts `{"name": ""}` to `TripCreateView` and asserts a 400. Found failing during the pod
verification of an unrelated trips-list-page/safety-checkin feature (2026-07-25) - not touched by
that work. `TripCreateView.post` (`controllers/trip.py`) already has: `name = (body.get("name")
or "").strip() or random_trip_name()` - per its own "Name is optional (UL-360)" comment, a blank
submission has deliberately generated a random name instead of rejecting the request since UL-360
shipped (2026-07-24, see the Feature build entry above). The test predates that change and was
never updated; it should either assert `200` + a non-empty generated `trip.name`, or be deleted
if UL-360's own test coverage (`test_trip_names.py`?) already covers the generated-name path.

## Full-codebase audit: re-verification pass (2026-07-25)

After the initial 35-unit audit (above) was worked through fix-by-fix in an earlier session, six
independent re-verification passes re-read every finding in `docs/notes/ai/codebase-audit.md`
against the current code (not trusting the earlier session's own claims) and reported per-finding
FIXED/PARTIALLY-FIXED/NOT-FIXED/REGRESSED verdicts. Most findings held up as genuinely fixed; the
handful of regressions and higher-value gaps the re-verification surfaced were fixed directly in
this pass:

- **`services/ai/openai.py`'s `get_client()`** unconditionally passed `base_url=str(self.api_url)`
  to the OpenAI SDK. `OpenAIGateway.setup()` never actually sets `api_url` (unlike the
  Cloudflare/HuggingFace gateways), so this was always `str(None)` - the literal string `"None"` -
  meaning a real OpenAI call would have tried to connect to that instead of the SDK's real default
  endpoint. Pre-existing bug, not a regression from the earlier fix pass; now only passes
  `base_url` when set.
- **SpotGuessr's new reverse-geocode cache (`services/spotguessr/geo_bonus.py`) treated a rate-limit
  failure as a genuine "no result" and cached it for the full 30-day TTL** - a transient Nominatim
  rate-limit hit (the exact failure mode the cache exists to work around) would have silently
  disabled the country/state/city bonus for an entire ~111m cell for a month. `reverse_geocode_admin`
  (`services/apis/locations/nominatim.py`) now lets request/transport failures propagate instead of
  swallowing them to `None`, and `geo_bonus.py` gives a failed lookup a 60-second TTL instead of 30
  days, while a genuine "nothing found" result still gets the long TTL.
- **The undo framework's `stash_for_undo()` calls in `pin_bulk.py`, `detail_pins.py` (×2), and
  `location_wiki.py` ran *before* the `transaction.atomic()` block wrapping the delete**, with a
  comment claiming the atomic wrapper prevented a partial-delete-with-stashed-undo inconsistency -
  it didn't, since the stash (an immediate `UndoAction.objects.create()`) had already committed
  before the atomic block even opened. Moved the stash call inside each atomic block, before the
  delete, so a mid-delete failure now rolls back both together.
- **The storage-quota check-then-create race (`services/storage.py`'s `per_profile_upload_lock`)
  was only wired up at 2 of 8 call sites** (`photos.py`, `image_gallery.py`) - `article.py`,
  `direct_messages.py`, `maps.py`, `safety.py`, `tools.py`, and `visits.py` still raced. All six now
  wrap their check-then-create in `per_profile_upload_lock`.
- **`LocationManager.get_nearby_or_create()`** (unlike `PinManager`'s already-fixed version) had no
  `try/except IntegrityError` around its `create()` call, despite `Location` having a real
  `unique_together = ["latitude", "longitude"]` constraint that two concurrent requests creating a
  Location at the exact same coordinates could hit. Now catches it and returns the
  concurrently-created row, matching `PinManager`'s pattern.
- **`services/direct_messages.py`'s email/text-alert debounce (`is_email_debounced`/
  `is_text_alert_debounced`) was still a plain `cache.get()` check-then-later-`cache.set()`** - the
  same TOCTOU shape already fixed in the sibling `notification_text_alerts.py` via atomic
  `cache.add()`. Ported the same fix; the now-redundant `cache.set()` calls inside
  `send_message_email_now`/`send_message_text_alerts_now` were removed since the marker is claimed
  atomically by the check itself. (`test_direct_messages.py`'s debounce test was rewritten to
  exercise this through the real task entry point, matching how the sibling module's tests already
  verify the same pattern.)
- **`services/ai/assistant.py`'s `_tool_add_trip_activity`** had the identical TOCTOU race
  (`trip.activities.count() >= max_activities` check-then-create) that `_tool_create_trip` and
  `link_extraction.start_link_extraction` had just been fixed for in the same pass - it wasn't
  itself covered. Now locks the `Trip` row (not the profile - the count is per-trip, and other
  members can add activities to the same trip) for the check-then-create.
- **Duplicate, conflicting dark-mode CSS for `.subscription-admin-page .role-pill`** - independent
  fix passes had added a `[data-theme="dark"]` override in both `_admin.scss` and `_dark.scss`,
  with different colors; `_admin.scss`'s `@use` order meant its version always won, making the
  `_dark.scss` copy dead and misleading. Removed the dead copy.
- **The undo framework's `MODEL_LABEL` constants** (added to `handlers/pin.py`, `handlers/wiki.py`,
  `handlers/safety_checkin.py` specifically to stop call sites hand-typing `"pin"`/`"wiki"`/
  `"safety_checkin"` as bare strings) were never actually imported at any of the ~8
  `stash_for_undo(...)` call sites - the fix added the constants but didn't wire them up. Added the
  missing `MODEL_LABEL` constants to `handlers/saved_filter.py`/`handlers/trip.py` and updated every
  call site (`pin_bulk.py`, `detail_pins.py`, `location_wiki.py`, `safety.py`, `saved_filters.py`,
  `trip.py`, `models/pin/viewset.py`) to import and use the shared constant instead of a literal.

**Confirmed still open** (verified genuinely unfixed, not worth blocking on for this pass - listed
here so the next session doesn't have to re-derive them from `docs/notes/ai/codebase-audit.md`'s
full per-unit detail):

- `services/direct_messages.py`'s TOCTOU fix above only covers the DM email/text debounce; the
  underlying **`quota_error_for_upload`/`per_profile_upload_lock` pattern itself is a "soft" lock**
  (proceeds without the lock if it can't be acquired promptly) - fine for its stated purpose but
  worth remembering it's not a hard guarantee.
- **Unit 08**: `pin.py`'s `media_send_to_wiki` still synchronously downloads up to 20 media items
  in the request handler; no shared upload helper exists despite the sequence being duplicated
  across ~8 call sites now sharing the same lock.
- **Unit 09/10**: bulk-accept/reject's per-item failures still aren't surfaced in the frontend
  toast; both trip-invite paths and calendar-push still loop per-invitee/per-activity without
  batching or debounce; `TripActivity.order` still has no uniqueness constraint or locking.
- **Unit 13/14/19**: `controllers/labels.py`'s `ai_kind_enabled`/`keyword_kind_enabled` duplication
  between `.get`/`.post` is unchanged; `NotificationPreference` still only models 12 of 30
  `NotificationType` values; no admin can see/revoke another admin's subscription grants; no
  restore tooling exists for the Postgres backups.
- **Unit 20**: `PinSerializer.create()` and `parse_for_preview` still make synchronous/blocking AI
  calls in the request cycle rather than via Celery; `services/ai/huggingface.py` is still an
  unwired, `NotImplementedError`-raising stub (now explicitly documented as such, rather than a
  silent dead end).
- **Unit 21/22/23**: `models/pin/viewset.py`'s post-`get_object()` ownership re-check is still dead
  code (queryset already filters it); `GroupMessage` still carries no images/markup_map/
  location_mentions/reply_to fields; `GameSessionConsumer`/`TriviaSessionConsumer` are still
  near-duplicate classes with no shared base, no per-connection rate limiting on any WS `receive()`.
- **Unit 24/25**: the SpotGuessr/Trivia `eligible_locations()`/`eligible_questions()` retry loops
  still re-run the full query on every attempt instead of computing the eligible set once; no
  moderation UI exists for AI-flagged trivia questions; neither game has a leave/cancel/kick path
  once a lobby exists.
- **Unit 31**: `_dark.scss` is still ~1100 lines of per-selector overrides (the role-pill fix above
  removed one duplicate, not the pattern); `_pin_lists.scss` still has 3 sibling raw-hex danger-red
  controls without dark overrides (`.pin-list-more-menu-danger`, `.saved-filter-delete-btn`, and its
  hover state) that PROBLEMS.md already flagged as a follow-up.
- **Unit 34**: only ~30/111 `@given`-using test files import the shared `strategies.py` module
  (up from 8/97, but still a minority); `test_trivia_wiki_incorporation.py` has zero `@given` tests
  despite an obvious property-testing candidate (the upvote-count threshold logic); a prior
  session's claim that hypothesis tests were added to `test_safety.py`/
  `test_safety_checkin_slugs.py`/`test_trip_controller.py` does not hold up under inspection - those
  three files still have zero `@given` tests (only `test_trip_helpers.py` and the two genuinely new
  files, `test_safety_archival.py` and `test_trivia_wiki_incorporation.py`, show real hypothesis
  work, and the latter's own tests are all hardcoded-value examples).

All of the above are maintainability/completeness gaps, not active security or correctness bugs
(those categories were the ones fixed directly, above) - reasonable to pick up as a dedicated
follow-up rather than blocking this pass.
